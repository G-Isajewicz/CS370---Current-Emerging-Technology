    In this project, I was required to complete the implementation of an AI model to play a pirate treasure hunt game. The goal of the game is for the agent to navigate the 
maze to locate a treasure at the other end without hitting any of the traps along the way. To complete this task, I was provided with two Python files. One file, 
TreasureHunt.py, is used to define the environment -a maze - and define a reward method for the agent making moves in the maze. The other, GameExperience.py provides the 
methodology for saving "memories" of playthroughs that the agent can use for exploitation. Also provided is a starer code for the implementation of the AI agent. This code 
includes a definition to establish a neural network as well as certain other core aspects of the model. The code I created myself is the portion that implements the deep
Q-learning algorithm, guiding the machine learning process and instructing the agent on how and when to save experiences and update Q-values.

    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is undoubtedly a growing field in computer science and, I believe, is likely to unlock yet unknown potential to future
technological advancements. This project has laid the groundwork for understanding the logical concepts behind these emerging technologies in their most basic forms. 
Computer scientists, on a very basic level, study computers and the computational methods used in them; they design algorithms, software systems, and test computational
theories. This is an important field because technology and computer science underpins all of modern society and likely will continue to do so into the future. Nearly 
everything we interact with in our daily lives contains or is enabled by some form of computer. 

    In approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I first seek to understand the problem clearly by identifying the requirements, limitations, and general logic 
of the thing. I will collect the relevent data such as the existing code, files, and other software and hardware, and analyze how they work together. From there, I will 
break down the problem into compartmentalized pieces and tackle one piece at a time by implementing some form of algorithm, testing it, and repeating as necessary until 
an appropriate solution is achieved. 

    As a computer scientist, I have certain ethical responsibilities to the end users and to the organizations I work for. In a general sense, I must seek to ensure that the 
software and algorithms I produce are not only accurately functional, but also free of bias and include appropriate preventative security features. I alos have an obligation to 
continue education by staying current on industry issues and topics, and strive toward transparency in my work in order to allow for accountability. No one is perfect and 
everyone will make mistakes, however by maintaining accountability and transparency, we can prevent those mistakes causing damage to individuals or organizations.
